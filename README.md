### Development Approach

1.  Kanban using Trello at https://trello.com/b/1k7otVhD/bookbazaar
2.  TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests before coding features.
3.  Code Documentation: Comment code and maintain clear documentation for each model.
4.  Version Control: Use Git with feature branching strategy.

### Project Deployment

-   Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### Final Deliverables

-   Source code.
-   API documentation.
-   User manual.
-   Test cases and results.
-   Deployment scripts and instructions.

## Testing

1.  Unit Testing:
    -   Write unit tests for individual components within each modl.
    -   Utilize xUnit.net as your testing framework.
    -   Ensure that you cover edge cases, failure modes, and happy paths.

2.  Integration Testing:
    -   Test the interactions between models to validate the integrated system behavior.
    -   Mock external dependencies or use in-memory databases like SQLite for .NET to simulate real-world scenarios.
    -   Tools like Postman or Swagger can be used for testing RESTful APIs.

3.  Functional Testing:
    -   Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the application from a user's perspective.
    -   Automate user interactions using a tool like Selenium for web applications.

4.  Load Testing:
    -   Test how your system behaves under high load conditions.
    -   Use tools like JMeter or Apache Bench to simulate multiple users accessing your application concurrently.
    -   Focus on identifying bottlenecks, latency issues, and potential crashes.

5.  Security Testing:
    -   Validate the security aspects of your application.
    -   Ensure that user data is protected, authentication mechanisms are robust, and APIs are secured against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
    -   Tools like OWASP ZAP can be used for security testing.

6.  Code Quality Analysis:
    -   Use tools like SonarQube to analyze your code for quality issues, code smells, and technical debt.
    -   Ensure coding standards are maintained and best practices are followed.

7.  Performance Testing:
    -   Monitor and test the performance of your application, focusing on response times, resource usage, and throughput.
    -   Use profiling tools to identify performance issues and optimize code where necessary.

8.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
    -   Engage real users or stakeholders to test the application in a production-like environment.
    -   Gather feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience.

9.  Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Validation:
    -   Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline correctly builds, tests, and deploys your application.
    -   Automate your testing as part of the pipeline to ensure that changes do not break the application.

10. Monitoring and Logging:
    -   Implement monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of your application in real-time.
    -   Use tools like ELK Stack or Prometheus and Grafana for logging and monitoring.

11. Documentation and Code Review:
    -   Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
    -   Conduct code reviews with peers or mentors to get feedback and identify potential issues.

12. Compliance and Best Practices:
    -   Ensure your application complies with industry standards and best practices.
    -   Stay updated with the latest .NET guidelines and architectural best practices.
