# BookBazaar - An Online Bookstore

## Development

### Description

BookBazaar is an online bookstore designed to manage book inventories, user orders, and data analytics. It will use a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficient resource utilization.

### Technical Specifications

1.  Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API with C#
2.  Database: Azure Cloud SQL Server
3.  APIs: RESTful APIs for communication between services.
4.  Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
5.  Containerization: Docker for containerizing services.
6.  Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing containerized services.
7.  Frontend: React (TypeScript)
8.  Cloud Platform: Azure
9.  DevOps Tools: Git for version control; CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or Azure DevOps.
10. Testing: xUnit for unit testing; Postman for API testing; Selenium for UI testing.

### Microservices Architecture

1.  User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2.  Inventory Service: Manages books' details, stock levels, and categorization.
3.  Order Service: Processes orders, manages shopping carts, and tracks order status.
4.  Payment Service: Processes payments and handles payment gateway integrations.
5.  Recommendation Service: Provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchase history.
6.  Analytics Service: Gathers and analyzes data for business insights, like popular books, sales trends, etc.

### Key Features

#### User Service

-   User registration and login functionality.
-   Profile management (update user details, view purchase history).
-   Role-based access control (admin, user).

#### Inventory Service

-   CRUD operations for book details (title, author, genre, price, stock quantity).
-   Search functionality (by title, author, genre).
-   Book categorization (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, educational).

#### Order Service

-   Shopping cart management.
-   Order placement and confirmation.
-   Order status tracking (placed, shipped, delivered).

#### Payment Service

-   Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
-   Secure handling of payment transactions.
-   Support for different payment methods (credit/debit card, net banking).

#### Recommendation Service

-   Algorithm to suggest books based on user preferences and previous orders.
-   Feature to rate and review books.

#### Analytics Service

-   Dashboard for sales data visualization.
-   Reports on top-selling books, customer demographics, and sales trends.
-   Real-time data updates.

### Development Approach

1.  Kanban using Trello
2.  TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests before coding features.
3.  Code Documentation: Comment code and maintain clear documentation for each service.
4.  Version Control: Use Git with feature branching strategy.

### Project Deployment

-   Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
-   Use Docker containers for deploying each microservice.
-   Employ Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling.

### Final Deliverables

-   Source code for each microservice.
-   API documentation.
-   User manual.
-   Test cases and results.
-   Deployment scripts and instructions.

## Testing

1.  Unit Testing:
    -   Write unit tests for individual components within each microservice.
    -   Utilize xUnit.net as your testing framework.
    -   Ensure that you cover edge cases, failure modes, and happy paths.

2.  Integration Testing:
    -   Test the interactions between microservices to validate the integrated system behavior.
    -   Mock external dependencies or use in-memory databases like SQLite for .NET to simulate real-world scenarios.
    -   Tools like Postman or Swagger can be used for testing RESTful APIs.

3.  Functional Testing:
    -   Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the application from a user's perspective.
    -   Automate user interactions using a tool like Selenium for web applications.

4.  Load Testing:
    -   Test how your system behaves under high load conditions.
    -   Use tools like JMeter or Apache Bench to simulate multiple users accessing your application concurrently.
    -   Focus on identifying bottlenecks, latency issues, and potential crashes.

5.  Security Testing:
    -   Validate the security aspects of your application.
    -   Ensure that user data is protected, authentication mechanisms are robust, and APIs are secured against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
    -   Tools like OWASP ZAP can be used for security testing.

6.  Code Quality Analysis:
    -   Use tools like SonarQube to analyze your code for quality issues, code smells, and technical debt.
    -   Ensure coding standards are maintained and best practices are followed.

7.  Container and Orchestration Validation:
    -   Test the Docker containerization of your services to ensure they are correctly built and deployed.
    -   Validate Kubernetes configurations for service discovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

8.  Performance Testing:
    -   Monitor and test the performance of your application, focusing on response times, resource usage, and throughput.
    -   Use profiling tools to identify performance issues and optimize code where necessary.

9.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
    -   Engage real users or stakeholders to test the application in a production-like environment.
    -   Gather feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience.

10. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Validation:
    -   Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline correctly builds, tests, and deploys your application.
    -   Automate your testing as part of the pipeline to ensure that changes do not break the application.

11. Monitoring and Logging:
    -   Implement monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of your application in real-time.
    -   Use tools like ELK Stack or Prometheus and Grafana for logging and monitoring.

12. Documentation and Code Review:
    -   Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
    -   Conduct code reviews with peers or mentors to get feedback and identify potential issues.

13. Compliance and Best Practices:
    -   Ensure your application complies with industry standards and best practices.
    -   Stay updated with the latest .NET guidelines and architectural best practices.
